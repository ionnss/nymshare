# NEXT FLOWS

## Channel Creation Flow
1. **User Registration**
   - User provides email (any valid email, any provider)
   - Email verification required
   - If email exists, old channel/public key deleted after verification

2. **Key Generation (Browser-side)**
   - Uses Web Crypto API in JavaScript
   - Generates public/private keypair client-side
   - Private key never touches our server
   - Automatic download of private key file to user's device
   - No recovery options - user responsibility

3. **Server Storage**
   - Only stores:
     - Verified email
     - Public key
     - Channel information

4. **Channel Access**
   - Generates unique channel URL/QR code
   - Based on public key
   - Shareable with potential whistleblowers


## File Sharing Flow (Whistleblowers)
1. **Access**
   - No account needed
   - Access via channel URL or QR code

2. **File Upload**
   - Whistleblower uploads raw files
   - **Backend Processing**:
     1. Server strips all metadata from files (using tools like `exiftool`)
     2. Server encrypts files using recipient's public key
     3. Encrypted files stored in VPS directory
     4. Auto-delete after 24 hours or as established by the whistleblower

3. **File Access (Channel Owner)**
   - Receives EMail notification
   - Downloads encrypted file
   - Uses their private key file to decrypt locally on the browser

This approach has several advantages:
- More robust metadata stripping (server-side tools are more thorough)
- Consistent encryption process
- Less dependency on browser capabilities
- Better handling of large files
- Simpler client-side code


4. **Channel URL Format**
- When recipient creates channel, they get a URL like:
  ```
  https://nymshare.com/share/{public_key_or_identifier}
  ```
- This same data is encoded in the QR code

5. **Sender Experience**
- Scans QR or clicks URL
- Automatically redirected to sharing page
- The public key is already loaded/available in the page
- No need for sender to manually input or paste any keys
- They just select and upload files, the encryption happens automatically using the pre-loaded public key

Benefits:
- Seamless user experience for whistleblowers
- No chance of wrong key being used
- Single step process (just upload files)
- Less room for user error
